This README outlines the details of collaborating on this ASP.NET application.

## Description
### This is a project that was started and we were given instruction to finish it as the previous developer was no longer available to complete the work. We were also given the breakdown of was was completed, in progress or still to do as follow:
COMPLETED:
* Users can register and log on
* Users may sign up to be "workers" on the site.
* New jobs may be added to the jobs list.
* A job can be assigned to a worker.
* A worker may take on mulitple jobs from the Worker Dashboard.

IN PROGRESS
* Make *claiming* a job an **AJAX** action.

NEXT UP
* A worker may designate one **active** job at a time. **AJAX**
* Workers may mark jobs complete, and select a new active job. **AJAX**

### In addition, the project should also meet the following criteria:
* Code meet general coding standards (commits, spacing, naming, etc)
* Tests was written to verify that all routes are returning views
* Routes follow proper convention
* Form and route helpers are present and functioning
* The app use a Layout file for styling across the app, including images
* Database should be written code-first, with clear migration instruction
* The application works as expected
* Application uses AJAX successfully. All requested AJAX functionality is present and working.
* Code is clear, easy to understand, and well-refactored.
* The required functionality must be present by the end of class Friday 02/24/17
* The project should be in a polished, portfolio-quality state
* The project demonstrate understanding of this week's concepts; If prompted, be ready to discuss our code with an instructor using the correct terminology.

This project was developed during a "Code Review" session at Epicodus, which is a solo project designed to test our knowledge of the materials learned over the previous week's study. It's an honor to be part of a coding community where people are genuinely interested in what they're doing.
